## Lab 01
The purpose of this lab is to build 7 segment LED display decoder.
We will be using 2 to 4 decoder (decode 2), 7-Segment decoder (decode 7) and 4x4 bit memory (bcit-id).
Before we inmplement to the FPGA board, we will be simulating the code using ModelSIM & AD2.

## Lab 02
The purpose of this lab is to implement a simple finite state machine and read input from a rotary encoder. 
Left Rotary encoder controls the first two digits of 7-segement ranging from 00 to 99 as well as right side
controls the last two digits from 00 to 99.
